## TODO
- Create presentation
- Create plots for presentation
- Try to find reason that causes random exploration to perform better than random sampling shooting
  - use random exploration instead of complete random sampling of data points to evaluate one-step predicitive accuracy
- Set up server to run random sampling shooting + MPC

## Presentation Outline
- Introduction to our topic/Introduction to the problem we are trying to solve
- Presentation of active learning and random sampling shooting via flow chart
- Experiments we have conducted so far including plots
  - Learning curves including train and test error
  - Active Learning evaluation
  - Plot for exploration efficiency
